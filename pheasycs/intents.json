Transmission lines may either be constructed overhead on towers, underground or they may be sub transmission lines. Overhead lines are very high voltage and do most of the long-distance transmission. They must be high voltage to minimize power losses of resistance. Underground lines are used to transport electricity to populated areas, underwater, or anywhere that overhead lines cannot be used. They are less common than overhead lines due to heat-related losses and higher costs. Sub transmission lines carry lower voltages to distribution stations and can be overhead or underground. Electrical transmission usually delivers generated electricity over a long distance to the distribution grid located in populated areas. An important part of this process includes the transformers which are used to increase voltage levels to make a long-distance transmission feasible. Electrical Grid is the electrical transmission system combined with power plants, distribution systems, and sub-stations. This grid meets society’s electrical needs and is what gets the electrical power from generation to its end-user. The power lines, on the other hand, transport electricity from place to place, usually, alternating current is used, so the step-up transformers can increase the voltage. This increases voltage allows efficient transmission and sends large amounts of electrical power and is extended over considerable distances."],

The addition of more light bulbs in series circuits causes a decrease in the brightness of the bulbs.

Considering that the formula in finding the area is 1 x w, we can make the equation: \n 3.0 x 4.0 = 12 m^2.

Faraday's first apparatus consisted of two coils mounted on a wooden spool. The first coil was attached to a battery and a switch, was called the primary coil. The other coil was attached to a galvanometer and was called the secondary coil At first, he did not observe any deflection in the galvanometer when he closed the switch So he installed a more powerful battery composed of a hundred cells. Even with that number, the effects he observed were very faint and transient, and yet for him, that was enough Faraday also observed that the galvanometer needle deflected in one direction whenever the switch was closed and returned to zero immediately, even when current was present in the primary coil. As soon as he opened the switch, meaning current no longer flowed in the primary coil, he again observed that the galvanometer needle deflected in the opposite direction and then promptly returned to zero \n Faraday repeated the experiments, this time replacing the wooden spool with a ferromagnetic core. He used a soft iron ring to concentrate the magnetic force. This time the deflection of the needle unmistakably showed the presence of an induced current in the secondary coil He also discovered that change was the crucial aspect of electromagnetic induction a changing magnetic field generated a current After writing and reporting about this phenomenon, he went on to use his new knowledge to build an electric generator. Through his experiments, Faraday has shown that a changing magnetic field induces current in a nearby coil. Let us perfor activities that show how this phenomenon occurs. \nMichael Faraday devised the world's first electric generator in 1821. The generator he built was a seemingly simple thing: a hand- cranked copper disk rotated between the poles of a permanent magnet. Charges in the metal are set in motion across the field as the disk turns, and experience a radial force acting along the conductor. The work done on the mobile charges creates the potential difference. As long as the rate of rotation is kept constant, the induced voltage is also kept quite steady. This was Faraday's generator or dynamo. The induced voltage is quite small and the device may have become impractical, yet it probably had the greatest impact on society than any other invention in the world."],

Parallelogram Method - a graphical method of getting the resultant vector but limited only up to two vectors. \nb.) Polygon Method - otherwise known as the head-to-tail method. This method is the most flexible type of graphical method. This is useful for two or more vectors. \nScaling- assigning scales to represent vectors in graphical method is essential. Take note that the resultant vector must carry the given unit and not the unit assigned in the appropriate scale. Example of scaling: 20 km, East :Scale: 1cm=4km therefore when you plot this using graphical, the original given will then be 5cm, East. Remember that the same scale must be used in all the given vector in a given problem. \n(2) Analytical Method (Component) - The most accurate method in vector addition. In this method the components of every given vector are mathematically or analytically solved. This is applicable for two or more vectors.
