Transmission lines may either be constructed overhead on towers, underground or they may be sub transmission lines. Overhead lines are very high voltage and do most of the long-distance transmission. They must be high voltage to minimize power losses of resistance. Underground lines are used to transport electricity to populated areas, underwater, or anywhere that overhead lines cannot be used. They are less common than overhead lines due to heat-related losses and higher costs. Sub transmission lines carry lower voltages to distribution stations and can be overhead or underground. Electrical transmission usually delivers generated electricity over a long distance to the distribution grid located in populated areas. An important part of this process includes the transformers which are used to increase voltage levels to make a long-distance transmission feasible. Electrical Grid is the electrical transmission system combined with power plants, distribution systems, and sub-stations. This grid meets society’s electrical needs and is what gets the electrical power from generation to its end-user. The power lines, on the other hand, transport electricity from place to place, usually, alternating current is used, so the step-up transformers can increase the voltage.
