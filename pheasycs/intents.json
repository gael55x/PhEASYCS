Transmission lines may either be constructed overhead on towers, underground or they may be sub transmission lines. Overhead lines are very high voltage and do most of the long-distance transmission. They must be high voltage to minimize power losses of resistance. Underground lines are used to transport electricity to populated areas, underwater, or anywhere that overhead lines cannot be used. They are less common than overhead lines due to heat-related losses and higher costs. Sub transmission lines carry lower voltages to distribution stations and can be overhead or underground. Electrical transmission usually delivers generated electricity over a long distance to the distribution grid located in populated areas. An important part of this process includes the transformers which are used to increase voltage levels to make a long-distance transmission feasible. Electrical Grid is the electrical transmission system combined with power plants, distribution systems, and sub-stations. This grid meets society’s electrical needs and is what gets the electrical power from generation to its end-user. The power lines, on the other hand, transport electricity from place to place, usually, alternating current is used, so the step-up transformers can increase the voltage. This increases voltage allows efficient transmission and sends large amounts of electrical power and is extended over considerable distances."],

Considering that the formula in finding the area is 1 x w, we can make the equation: \n 3.0 x 4.0 = 12 m^2. Both sides are dimensionally equal. \nThis is very useful especially if you want to check if the equation is in its correct form.",

Faraday's first apparatus consisted of two coils mounted on a wooden spool. The first coil was attached to a battery and a switch, was called the primary coil. The other coil was attached to a galvanometer and was called the secondary coil At first, he did not observe any deflection in the galvanometer when he closed the switch So he installed a more powerful battery composed of a hundred cells. Even with that number, the effects he observed were very faint and transient, and yet for him, that was enough Faraday also observed that the galvanometer needle deflected in one direction whenever the switch was closed and returned to zero immediately, even when current was present in the primary coil. As soon as he opened the switch, meaning current no longer flowed in the primary coil, he again observed that the galvanometer needle deflected in the opposite direction and then promptly returned to zero \n Faraday repeated the experiments, this time replacing the wooden spool with a ferromagnetic core. He used a soft iron ring to concentrate the magnetic force. This time the deflection of the needle unmistakably showed the presence of an induced current in the secondary coil He also discovered that change was the crucial aspect of electromagnetic induction a changing magnetic field generated a current After writing and reporting about this phenomenon, he went on to use his new knowledge to build an electric generator. Through his experiments, Faraday has shown that a changing magnetic field induces current in a nearby coil. Let us perfor activities that show how this phenomenon occurs. \nMichael Faraday devised the world's first electric generator in 1821. The generator he built was a seemingly simple thing: a hand- cranked copper disk rotated between the poles of a permanent magnet. Charges in the metal are set in motion across the field as the disk turns, and experience a radial force acting along the conductor. The work done on the mobile charges creates the potential difference. As long as the rate of rotation is kept constant, the induced voltage is also kept quite steady. This was Faraday's generator or dynamo. The induced voltage is quite small and the device may have become impractical, yet it probably had the greatest impact on society than any other invention in the world."],

These transformers, which are found on electric poles, finally bring the voltage down to 220 volts The electrical energy is then passed on to secondary lines. Electrical energy is carried from secondary lines by the service wires to the consumer's circuits. The consumer's circuit, such as a household circuit, is connected to the service wire through a wattmeter (also called an electric meter) located in a conspicuous part of the building.

Fascinated with the idea that light as a wave can have a particle like property, in 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie proposed  that electrons and other discrete bits of matter, which until then had been conceived only as material particles, must also have wave properties such as wavelength and frequency. Later in 1927 the wave nature of electrons was experimentally established by American physicists ClintonDavisson and Lester Germer on their Davisson-Germer experiment. An understanding of the complementary relation between the wave aspects and the particle aspects of the same phenomenon was announced by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1928. Electron being considered as a wave created questions that gain the interest of other fellow scientist. Among the question that lingered on the minds of other   scientists   was that 'if electron traveled as a wave, then where could be the precise position of the electron within the wave?'The answer to this question was given by German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927, in his famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. He articulated that both the momentum and position of the electron can not be measured exactly at the same time. Another scientist in the name of Erwin Shrodinger derived set of equations also called wavefunctions for electrons as a result of  de Broglie’s hypothesis and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. He formulated the equations that would specify that the electrons confined in their orbits would set up standing waves and the probability of finding the electrons in the orbitals could be described as the electron density clouds. The greatest probability of finding an electron in an orbital is in the densest area, likewise, the lowest probability of finding an electron in in the orbital of least dense."],

This happens because the air resistance acting against the feather quickly increases until it is equal and opposite to the weight.

The feather is very light and has a relatively large surface area, so it doesn't have to fall very fast for air resis- tance to equal its weight. The same idea applies to all objects falling in air. As a falling object gains speed, the force of air resistance finally builds up until it equals the weight of the falling object. When this happens, the net force becomes zero and the object no longer accelerates; it falls at a constant speed. When acceleration terminates, we say the object has reached its terminal speed. If we are concerned with direction, down for falling objects, we say the object has reached its terminal velocity.

If the circuit is connected to a direct current of 220 volts, compute for the: \na. The total resistance in the circuit; \nb. The total current in the circuit; \nc. The voltage drop in each appliance.\nTo solve what is asked in the problem, recall the result of the first activity on \nseries connection: \nRT = R1 + R2 + R3 ... \nVT = V1 + V2 + V3 ... \nIT = I1 = I2 = I3 ... \nIdentify what are given in the problem: \nR1 (refrigerator) = 20Ω \nR2 (TV set) = 10Ω \nR3 ( radio) = 5Ω \nR4 (electric iron) = 75 \nR5 (electric kettle) = 55Ω \nThese appliances are connected to 220 volt source (VT = 220 volts) \nAnd so to solve for the total resistance (RT); \na. RT = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 \nRT = 20Ω + 10Ω + 5Ω + 75Ω + 55Ω \nRT = 165 Ω \nb. Since the current in a series circuit is equal all throughout the circuit, we will use Ohm’s Law in solving the total current (IT). And so by Ohm’s Law: \nR = V ; so IT = VT \nI RT = 220V 165Ω \n= 1.33 A \nc. The voltage drop in each appliance is asked in the problem. And since the total voltage is also given, we can use Ohm’s Law to solve the individual voltages. Hence, \nR = V/I so; V = R x I \nFor individual voltages in each appliance we can have: \nFor refrigerator: V1 = R1 x I1 \n= 20Ω x 1.33 A \n= 26.6 V \n For TV set: \nV2 = R2 x I2 \n= 10Ω x 1.33 A \n= 13.3 V \n For radio: \nV3 = R3 x I3 = 5Ω x 1.33 A \n= 6.65 V \n For flat iron: \nV4 = R4 x I4 \n= 75Ω x 1.33 A \n= 99.75 V \n For electric kettle: \nV5 = R5 x I5 = 55Ω x 1.33 A = 73.15 V \n To check if the individual voltages are correct, their sum must be equal to the total voltage given in the problem which is 220 volts. This will coincide with the result of the first activity : VT = V1 + V2 + V3 ... So, VT = V1 + V2 + V3 + V4 + V5 \n= 26.6 V + 13.3 V + 6.65 V + 99.75 V + 73.15 V \n= 219.50 or 220 V \nHere is an example of solving parallel connections: \nLet us assume that you have five appliances connected in parallel.

To compute for the total current in the circuit, we need to solve for the individual current first. So by using Ohm’s law; \nR = V/I so, I = V/R \nI1 = V1/R1 = 220 V/20Ω = 11 A \nI2 = V2/R2 = 220 V/10Ω = 22 A\nI3 = V3/R3 = 220 V/5Ω = 44 A\nI4 = V4/R4 = 220 V/75 Ω = 2.9 A\nI5 = V5/R5 = 220 V/ 55Ω = 4 A\nIT = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 + I5\n= 11A + 22A + 44A + 2.9A + 4A = 83.9 A\nc. For a parallel connection, the individual voltages or the voltage drop in each device is equal to the total voltage in the circuit Thus, \nVT = V1 = V2 = V3 = V4 = V5\n220V = V1 = V2 = V3 = V4 = V5"],

For example, Aristotle believed that because a ball fell when thrown upward, its element was earth, and smoke goes up the air because it seeks its natural place in the atmosphere. The Aristotelian concept of natural motion is largely vertical motion which is falling or rising. As for horizontal motion, an object moving in a violent motion requires push or pull to maintain horizontal motion. Motion continues only so long as there is an applied force to an object. When the force is removed, motion stops. Violent motion is imposed motion  caused by pushing or pulling.   Aristotle classified any motion that required a force as a 'violent motion'. Lastly, Aristotle  believed  that  the  projectile  motion  of  an  object  is  parallel  to  the ground until it is the object's time to fall back into the ground. He viewed projectile motion as natural and violent motion.  He said that heavy objects fall faster than light ones."],

  "responses": ["As for vertical motion, in  the  absence  of  a  resistance,  objects  would  fall  not  depending  on  their weight, but in the time of fall. Also, if the object encountered a resistive force from a fluid  equal  or  greater  than  its  weight,  it  will  slow  down  and  reaches  a  uniform motion until it reaches the bottom and stops.For example, without any resistance, a 1-kg object will be as fast as a 10-kg object when falling because they fall with the same amount of time, given that they are released from the same height. In horizontal motion, an  object  in  motion,  if  unimpeded,  will  continue  to  be  in  motion,  and  an external force is not necessary to maintain the motion. If the Earth’s surface is very flat and extended infinitely, objects that are pushed will not be impeded. Thus, the objects  will  continue  to  move.  This  kind  of  motion,  however,  is  not  evident  in nature.For example, if a ball is pushed on an infinitely flat plane, the ball will continue to roll if unimpeded. Lastly, Galileo  performed  experiments  on  uniformly  accelerated  motion  using  an inclined plane, and used the same apparatus to study projectile motion. He believed that a projectile is a combination of uniform motion in the  horizontal direction and uniformly accelerated motion in the vertical direction. If it is not impeded, it will continue to move even without an applied force. For example, when you shoot a ball in a basketball ring, the ball does not  need a force to keep it moving"],

Let's say we bring a negatively charged balloon (you just rubbed it on your hair) towards one of the spheres. Since like charges repel, the electrons on the sphere will be repelled by the negative charge of the balloon. Note that the protons do not move toward the negative balloon, but that the side of the metal sphere to the balloon has a positive charge due to a lack of electrons. So there is a stronger negative charge in the furthest from the negative balloon. When the spheres are separated, we have two charged objects: one positive and one negative.

 "responses": ["Electrons in glass have a natural vibration frequency in the ultraviolet range. When ultraviolet rays shine on glass, resonance occurs as the wave builds and maintains a large amplitude of vibration of the electrons, just as pushing someone at the resonant frequency on a swing builds a large amplitude. The energy the atom receives may be passed on to neighboring atoms by collisions, or it may be re-emitted. Resonating atoms in the glass can hold onto the energy of the ultraviolet light for quite a long time (about 100 millionths of a second). During this time the atom makes about 1 million vibrations, and it collides with neighboring atoms and gives up its energy as heat. Thus, glass is not transparent to ultraviolet. At lower wave frequencies, like those of visible light, electrons in the glass are forced into vibration, but at less amplitude. The atom holds the energy for less time. with less chance of collision with neighboring atoms, and less energy transformed to heat. The energy of vibrating electrons is re-emitted as light. Clear glass is transparent to all visible light waves. The frequency of the re-emitted light that is passed from atom to atom is identical to the frequency of the light that produced the vibration in the first place. However, there is a slight time delay between absorption and re-emission. Infrared waves, with frequencies lower than those of visible light, vibrate not only the electrons, but entire atoms or molecules in the structure of the glass. This vibration increases the internal energy and temperature of the structure, which is why infrared waves are often called heat waves.

Long exposure times were required because of the small amount of light admitted by the pinhole. A somewhat larger hole would admit more light, but overlapping rays would produce a blurry image. Too large a hole would allow too much overlapping and no image would be discernible. That's where a converging lens comes in. The lens converges light onto the screen without the unwanted overlapping of rays. Whereas the first pinhole cameras were useful only for still objects because of the long exposure time required, moving objects can be taken with the lens camera because of the short exposure time. Now you know why photographs taken with lens cameras came to be called snapshots. \nThe simplest use of a converging lens is a magnifying glass. Magnification occurs when an image is observed through a wider angle with the use of a lens than without the lens. With unaided vision, an object far away is seen through a relatively small angle of view, while the same object when closer is seen through a larger angle of view. This wider angle permits the perception of greater detail. A magnifying glass is simply a converging lens that can increase the angle of view."],

For this reason, most optical instruments use compound lenses, each consisting of several simple lenses, instead of single lenses. \nSpherical aberration results from light that passes through the edges of a lens fo- cusing at a slightly different place from where light passing through the center of the lens focuses. This can be remedied by covering the edges of a lens, as with a diaphragm in a camera. Spherical aberration is corrected in good optical instruments by a combination of lenses.\nChromatic aberration is the result of light of different colors having different speeds and hence different refractions in the lens (Figure 27.54). In a simple lens (as in a prism), red light and blue light do not come to focus in the same place. \nAchromatic lenses, which combine simple lenses of different kinds of glass, correct this defect.. The pupil of the eye regulates the amount of light that enters the eye by changing its size. Vision is sharpest when the pupil is smallest because light then passes through only the center of the eye's lens, where spherical and chromatic aberrations are minimal. Also, the eye then acts more like a pinhole camera, so minimum focusing is required for a sharp image. You see better in bright light because your pupils are smaller. \nAstigmatism of the eye is a defect that results when the cornea is curved more in one direction than the other, somewhat like the side of a barrel. Because of this defect, the eye does not form sharp images. The remedy is eyeglasses with cylindrical lenses that have more curvature in one direction than in another."],

  "responses": ["If we modify the design of the galvanometer slightly, we have an electric motor. The principal difference is that the current is made to change direction every time the coil makes a half rotation. After being forced to turn one half rotation, it overshoots just in time for the current to reverse, whereupon it is forced to continue another half rotation. and so on in cyclic fashion to produce continuous rotation. A permanent magnet produces a magnetic field in a region where a rectangular loop of wire is mounted to turn about the axis shown. When a current passes through the loop. it flows in opposite directions in the upper and lower sides of the loop (it has to do this be cause if charge flows into one end of the loop, it must flow out the other end). If the upper portion of the loop is forced to the left, then the lower portion is forced to the right, as if it were a galvanometer. But unlike a galvanometer, the current is reversed during each half revolution by means of stationary contacts on the shaft. The parts of the wire that brush against these contacts are called brushes. In this way, the current in the loop alternates so that the forces in the upper and lower regions do not change directions as the loop rotates. The rotation is continuous as long as current is supplied. We have described here only a very simple de motor. Larger motors, de or ac, are usually made by replacing the permanent magnet by an electromagnet that is energized by the power source. Of course, more than a single loop is used. Many loops of wire are wound about an iron cylinder, called an armature, which then rotates when the wire car- ries current.We have described here only a very simple de motor.

Until now, barriers of time and distance prevented efficient and speedy interaction. Today, the boon of communication technology permits people from opposite poles to talk like next-door neighbors. Fundamental to these modes of communication is the conversion of light and sound to electrical energy, and the use of electromagnetic waves for the transmission and reception of information."],

Morse code sent by hand has a comparatively low bandwidth of only a few hertz. To give an acceptable reproduction of speech, telephone signals need a bandwidth of about 4,000 Hz, while hi-fi music needs about 20,000 Hz. Video signals, however, which contain information on the shape, color, and movement in a continuously changing scene, often occupy a bandwidth of more than 5 MHz. In radio transmission, stations are allocated different frequencies so that a receiver can tune into a particular station and exclude all others. To avoid interference, transmission frequencies must be spaced apart at least by the bandwidth of the modulating signal."],

The cathode-ray tube, originally developed for displaying electrical waveforms on a screen for engineering measurements, evolved into the television picture tube. Such tubes operate by forming the electrons into a thin beam that impinges on a fluorescent screen at the end of the tube. The screen, when hit by the fast-moving electrons, emits light that can be viewed from outside the tube. Deflecting the beam causes patterns of light to be produced on the screen, creating the optical images."],
